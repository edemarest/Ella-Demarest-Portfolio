          <h3 className="about-subheading">Hello!</h3>
          <p className="pb-2">I'm Ella! Though I've studied and worked all over the place the last few years, I am originally from San Diego, California.</p>
          <p className="pb-2">Ever since I was young, I've always been interested in making things, and that is just as true for me now.
            I absolutely love working on projects and seeing them through from start to end. My favorite days are ones where I can sit down and grind from morning to night with some music or a podcast and not think about anything else. That's what I did with this site, for example.
          </p>
          <p className="pb-2">
            Even though many of my interests involve sitting down at a computer, I spend a whole lot of time outside. I try to walk everywhere not just to get extra steps in,
            but because I play Pokemon Go. The app motivates me to go on a new adventure every weekend and walk to campus or work instead of taking the Boston T whenever the weather allows!
          </p>
          <p className="pb-2">I also take health and fitness very seriously; I work out 6 days a week and try to fit as much protein as possible into my day. Because of this, I always look forward to picking a brand new (or old favorite) dessert every Saturday. My current favorite is the edible cookie dough at Little Miss Cupcape.
          </p>
